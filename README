This is the README file for PasswrodCracker, a package which implements generating guessed passwords program

Introduction
============

PasswordCracker is a crack pawssword which using directory method.

Installation
============

1) Compiling for crack.cpp

$ make

2) Execute

$ ./crack.x word_file password_file

where crack.x is the program name.

The first parameter word_file is the name of the dictionary file, which contains all the words from which the crack.x program will generate guessed passwords.

The second parameter password_file is the name of a password file, which contains passwords that we would like to break.

The format of the word_file and password_file is the same: each line contains a single word or password, respectively.

The objective of the crack.x program is to generate guessed passwords using the word_file to match as many as possible the passwords given in the password_file.

New Rules
============

We create other rules for generating guessed password.

Some example rules are given below:

1) uppercase word can be replace by lowercase word

for example, if ¡§APPLE¡¨ is a word in the word_file, you can add apple

2) lowercase word can be replace by uppercase word

for example, the word ¡§mybigoh¡¨ can be replaced by number ¡§MYBIGOH"

Note
============

Given that the program can take a long time to complete depending on the number of rules, 

so you can use "CTRL + C" to terminate program if it has been running for too long.

This program will terminate if your program has correctly guessed all passwords in the password_file.
